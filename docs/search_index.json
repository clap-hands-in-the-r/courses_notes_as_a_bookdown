You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["learning-r.html", "Chapter 2 Learning R 2.1 Environment configuration 2.2 Basic manipulations 2.3 More advanced manipulations 2.4 How to explore a data frame? 2.5 About stringr package 2.6 About Regex in R 2.7 Creating samples 2.8 About dates 2.9 Useful packages or datasets 2.10 Useful libraries 2.11 Advance programming", " Chapter 2 Learning R This is notes about learning R.

The only difference is that the first solution returns a data frame whereas the second returns a vector.

Stringr functions always begin with prefix str_ ; the first argument is always the string you want to treat. And then comes the pattern you want to identify. Most common and useful functions in Stringr : str_detect() -&gt; returns a logical vector (a vector of TRUE and FALSE) str_subset() str_view() str_view_all() str_replace() str_replace_all() str_split() str_trim() str_to_lower() 2.6 About Regex in R 2.6.1 Special characters \\\\d stands for one of any digit 0,1,2, up to 9 \\\\s stands for one charater whitespace The dot “.” matches any character So, to match a literal dot “.” in regex, we need two backslashes then dot \\\\. The star “*” stands for 0 or more instances of the previous character The plus sign “+” stands for 1 or more instances of the previous character The question mark “?” stands for 0 or one instance of the previous character () () “\\\\1” capture le groupe de la parenthèse 1 et “\\\\2” capture le groupe de la parenthèse 2 Separate and extract function are from tidyr package.

P(A&amp;B) = P(A) * P(B) Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling the same number two times in a row? Since we don’t care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability is 1. The second roll of the dice has to match the outcome of the first, so that has a probability of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1 * 1/6.

Name it like you would name a variable in R. It must be unique. If it’s not unique, you’ll have no way to refer to this control in your server function! Most input functions have a second parameter called label. This is used to create a human-readable label for the control. Shiny doesn’t place any restrictions on this string, but you’ll need to carefully think about it to make sure that your app is usable by humans! The third parameter is typically value, which, where possible, lets you set the default value. The remaining parameters are unique to the control sliderInput(): If you supply a length-2 numeric vector for the default value of sliderInput(), you get a “range” slider with two ends. exemple : sliderInput(“rng”, “Range”, value = c(10, 20), min = 0, max = 100) Unlike a typical list, input objects are read-only. If you attempt to modify an input inside the server function, you’ll get an error. To read from an input, you must be in a reactive context created by a function like renderText() or reactive() 9.2.1.2 Output You always use the output object in concert with a render function, as in the following simple example. Link toward vers Mastering shiny from Hadley Wickham Each render{Type} function is designed to produce a particular type of output (e.g. text, tables, and plots), and is often paired with a {type}Output function. For example, in this app, renderPrint() is paired with verbatimTextOutput() to display a statistical summary with fixed-width (verbatim) text, and renderTable() is paired with tableOutput() to show the input data in a table. server ui textInput selectInput sliderInput passwordInput textAreaInput numericInput dateInput dateRangeInput radioButtons checkboxGroupInput fileInput actionButton renderPrint() verbatimTextOutput() renderTable() tableOutput() renderDataTable() dataTableOutput() renderPlot(,res = 96) plotOutput() renderText() textOutput() output\\(name xxxOutput(&quot;name&quot;) input\\)id_selected selectInput(“id_selected”, label) exemple of radioButton animals &lt;- c(“dog”, “cat”, “mouse”, “bird”, “other”, “I hate animals”) radioButtons(“animal”, “What’s your favourite animal?”, animals) Allow the user to select multiple elements selectInput( “state”, “What’s your favourite state?”, state.name, multiple = TRUE) There’s no way to select multiple values with radio buttons, but there’s an alternative that’s conceptually similar: checkboxGroupInput(). ui &lt;- fluidPage( checkboxGroupInput(“animal”, “What animals do you like?”, animals) ) You create a reactive expression by wrapping a block of code in reactive({…}) and assigning it to a variable, and you use a reactive expression by calling it like a function that is the name of the reactive expression we created followed by parentheses. Note that the {} are only required in render functions if need to run multiple lines of code. As you’ll learn shortly, you should do as little computation in your render functions as possible, which means you can often omit them To create a reactive expression, we call reactive() and assign the results to a variable. To later use the expression, we call the variable like it’s a function. exemple: server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { x1 &lt;- reactive(rnorm(input\\(n1, input\\)mean1, input$sd1)) Most simple exemple of reactive expression: server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { string &lt;- reactive(paste0(“Hello”, input\\(name, &quot;!&quot;)) output\\)greeting &lt;- renderText(string()) } Just like any other R function, when the server function is called it creates a new local environment that is independent of every other invocation of the function. This allows each session to have a unique state, as well as isolating the variables created inside the function. the order in which reactive code is run is determined only by the reactive graph, not by its layout in the server function.
